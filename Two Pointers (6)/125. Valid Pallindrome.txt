A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

Answer

🎯 Step 1: Clarify the Problem (what interviewer expects)

✅ Ignore non-alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9).
✅ Ignore case differences (A and a are same).
✅ Must check if the string reads the same forward and backward.


Approach : 

You can solve this in O(n) time and O(1) extra space using a two-pointer approach.

Initialize two pointers:
left = 0
right = s.length() - 1
Move pointers inward:
Skip characters that are not alphanumeric.
Compare lowercase of both characters.
If mismatch → return false.
If loop ends → return true.




Code snippet :

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length()-1;

        while (left < right) {
            while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left)))
                left++;
            while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right)))
                right--;

            if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right)))
                return false;
            left++;right--;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}



Q1: Can you handle Unicode (like emojis or accented letters)?

A:
Current solution works for ASCII alphanumeric only.
For Unicode, I can use Character.isLetterOrDigit() (already Unicode-aware), so this works fine for most scripts, but we might need normalization for combining marks.
