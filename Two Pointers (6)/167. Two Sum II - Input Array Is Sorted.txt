Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
 

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

Answer


Approach : 

Brute : Use two nested loops to check all pairs. Time: O(n²), Space: O(1).
Optimal : Two Pointer with left right. This yields O(n) time and O(1) space complexity




Code snippet :

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int sum = 0;
        int left = 0, right = numbers.length-1;
        while (left < right) {
            sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            if (sum == target) {
                return new int[] {left+1, right+1};
            } else if (target > sum) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return new int[] {-1, -1};
    }
}




Q1. What if there are multiple valid pairs?

The problem guarantees exactly one valid pair, so we can stop once found.
If multiple pairs were allowed, we could collect all valid pairs before returning.

Q2. What if array size is 1 or empty?

Then we can directly return {-1, -1} since we need two elements.
